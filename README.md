# PHP Trader Native

This is a PHP port of the Trader extension for PHP, which is a port of the TA-LIB C/Java code.

This port is written in PHP and without any other requirements.

The goal is that this library can be used by those whom cannot install the PHP Trader extension.

## Requirements

* PHP >= 7.0.0

That's the only thing you need!  As stated, you do not need to install any extensions for this library.
